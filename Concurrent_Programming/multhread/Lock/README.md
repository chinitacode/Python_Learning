# [Lock Objects](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#lock-objects) 
A primitive lock is a synchronization primitive that is not owned by a particular thread when locked.
In Python, it is currently the lowest level synchronization primitive available, implemented directly by the _thread extension module. 

A primitive lock is in one of two states, “locked” or “unlocked”.
It is created in the unlocked state. It has two basic methods, acquire() and release().
When the state is unlocked, acquire() changes the state to locked and returns immediately.
When the state is locked, acquire() blocks until a call to release() in another thread changes it to unlocked,
then the acquire() call resets it to locked and returns.
The release() method should only be called in the locked state;
it changes the state to unlocked and returns immediately.
If an attempt is made to release an unlocked lock, a RuntimeError will be raised. 

Locks also support the context management protocol. 

When more than one thread is blocked in acquire() waiting for the state to turn to unlocked,
only one thread proceeds when a release() call resets the state to unlocked;
which one of the waiting threads proceeds is not defined, and may vary across implementations. 

All methods are executed atomically. 

class threading. **Lock** 
The class implementing primitive lock objects. Once a thread has acquired a lock,
subsequent attempts to acquire it block, until it is released; any thread may release it. 

Note that Lock is actually a factory function which returns an instance of the most efficient
version of the concrete Lock class that is supported by the platform. 

**acquire**(blocking=True, timeout=-1) 
Acquire a lock, blocking or non-blocking. 

When invoked with the blocking argument set to True (the default),
block until the lock is unlocked, then set it to locked and return True. 

When invoked with the blocking argument set to False, do not block.
If a call with blocking set to True would block, return **False** immediately; otherwise, set the lock to locked and return **True**. 

When invoked with the floating-point timeout argument set to a positive value,
block for at most the number of seconds specified by timeout and as long as the lock cannot be acquired.
A timeout argument of -1 specifies an unbounded wait. It is forbidden to specify a timeout when blocking is false. 

The return value is True if the lock is acquired successfully,
False if not (for example if the timeout expired). 

Changed in version 3.2: The timeout parameter is new. 

Changed in version 3.2: Lock acquisition can now be interrupted by signals on POSIX
if the underlying threading implementation supports it. 

**release**() 
Release a lock. This can be called from any thread, not only the thread which has acquired the lock. 

When the lock is locked, reset it to unlocked, and return.
If any other threads are blocked waiting for the lock to become unlocked, allow exactly one of them to proceed. 

When invoked on an unlocked lock, a RuntimeError is raised. 

**There is no return value.** 

**locked**() 
Return **true** if the lock is acquired.
