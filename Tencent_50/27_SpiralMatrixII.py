59. Spiral Matrix II
Given a positive integer n, generate a square matrix filled with elements from 1 to n2 in spiral order.

Example:

Input: 3
Output:
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 8, 9, 4 ],
 [ 7, 6, 5 ]
 
 
 
Solution 1: Build it inside-out 

Start with the empty matrix, add the numbers in reverse order until we added the number 1. 
Always rotate the matrix clockwise and add a top row:

    ||  =>  |9|  =>  |8|      |6 7|      |4 5|      |1 2 3|
                     |9|  =>  |9 8|  =>  |9 6|  =>  |8 9 4|
                                         |8 7|      |7 6 5|
'''

def generateMatrix(self, n):
    A, lo = [], n*n+1
    while lo > 1:
        lo, hi = lo - len(A), lo
        A = [range(lo, hi)] + zip(*A[::-1])
    return A
While this isn't O(n^2), it's actually quite fast, presumably due to me not doing much in Python but relying on zip and range and + being fast. I got it accepted in 44 ms, matching the fastest time for recent Python submissions (according to the submission detail page).

Solution 2: Ugly inside-out 

Same as solution 1, but without helper variables. 
Saves a line, but makes it ugly. 
Also, because I access A[0][0], I had to handle the n=0 case differently.
'''
def generateMatrix(self, n):
    A = [[n*n]]
    while A[0][0] > 1:
        A = [range(A[0][0] - len(A), A[0][0])] + zip(*A[::-1])
    return A * (n>0)
    
'''
Solution 3: Walk the spiral

Initialize the matrix with zeros, then walk the spiral path and write the numbers 1 to n*n. 
Make a right turn when the cell ahead is already non-zero.
'''
def generateMatrix(self, n):
    A = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    i, j, di, dj = 0, 0, 0, 1
    for k in xrange(n*n):
        A[i][j] = k + 1
        if A[(i+di)%n][(j+dj)%n]:
            di, dj = dj, -di
        i += di
        j += dj
    return A
